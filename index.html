            there is a significant salary disparity between visible
            minorities and nonvisible minorities. Racial differences
            in job characteristics account for a larger portion of
            the explained racial salary gap than individual and
            labor market characteristics [and] the effect of race on
            salary is shown to be weaker for librarians than for
            support staff. (Li, 2021)

            The RCMP has shown that they can not reform their
            institution. They have come to be
            known as the 'Royal Canadian Disgrace' by their own
            inaction. The oft-repeated recommendations for
            sensitivity training, cultural-awareness training, or
            diverse hiring practices are not effective in rooting
            out racialized and sexualized violence against
            Indigenous peoples. The problem is not Indigenous
            culture, it's RCMP culture, which finds time and time
            again that the racial profiling, harassment, brutality
            and the killing of Indigenous peoples is somehow
            justified. (Palmater, 2020)

            This reductive view is far removed
            from the vast body of robust research, including our own,
            which identifies racism as key to generating and reinforcing
            longstanding health inequity. In health terms, inequity
            specifically refers to systematic differences in outcomes
            between groups that are unfair or discriminatory. This has
            never been more true than during a pandemic that is having a
            disproportionate effect on ethnic minority communities.

            You can no longer conduct black politics through the
            strategy of a simple set of reversals, putting in the place
            of the bad old essential white subject, the new essentially
            good black subject... [But] this does not make it any easier
            to conceive of how a politics can be constructed which works
            with and through difference, which is able to build those
            forms of solidarity and identification which make common
            struggle and resistance possible but without suppressing the
            real heterogeneity of interests and identities, and which
            can effectively draw the political boundary lines without
            which political contestation is impossible, without fixing
            those boundaries for eternity. (Hall, 1989)

            matter which has been invested with human energy and which
            henceforth takes the place of and functions like human
            action. The machine is of course the most basic symbol of
            this type of structure, but it is really only a physical
            symbol of it, and in concrete daily life the practico-inert
            most frequently takes the form of social institutions.
